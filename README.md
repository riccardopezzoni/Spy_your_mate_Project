The aim of the project was to start a video call and capture the network traffic with Wireshark, having frames with the person in the camera and frames with only the background. Then see how some Machine Learning recognizers handles the task to identify whether the person was in the video or not.
The results needed to be exported, with the ground truth data, in a Node-RED chart.
Logistic Regression, Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors were used as classifiers and compared with their confusion matrxi and accuracy metrix (precision, recall and f1-score)
